    <p>Here we have a graph that plots the amount of kilograms of coffee produced by each country.</p>
    <p>By no coincidence, the countries with the highest productions are located in areas of tropical climate, which makes sense,
         since arabica coffee's optimal temperaturerange is 18&#x2103 - 21&#x2103,
          tolerating mean annual temperatures up to 24&#x2103.</p>
    <p>Above those moderate temperatures, the seeds ripen more quickly. And since coffee beans are the seeds of the plant,
        that means less coffee quality; exposure to temperatures higher than 30&#x2103 can severely damage the seedlings,
         stunting growth, yellowing leaves, and even spawning stem tumors.
