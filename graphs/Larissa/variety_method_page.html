    <p>Here we have a graph that plots different coffee varieties against processing methods. </p>
    <p>The different processing methods cited refer to methods of removing the many layers of the coffee fruit in order to obtain its seeds.
        For example, in the most common processing method, washing, many of the layers are removed before the drying stage begins,
         as opposed to natural processing, in which the fruit is dried before the removal of its layers.
