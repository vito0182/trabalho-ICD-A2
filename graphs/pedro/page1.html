    <p>This plot aims to show the correlation between the coffee's scores on
       flavor and acidity, using a scatterplot. This type of graphic was chosen because
       it shows that the dots (representing different coffees) tends to have simillar
       scores on these aspects, meaning that when one gets higher, the other tends to
       get higher too. the size of each dot shows how many coffees had tha specific
       rating, since the scores are given in some cathegorical way, and plotting
       without that would lead to some dots overlapping others.
