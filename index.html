        <div class="text-container" id="text-graph1" style="display: none;">
            <p>Here we have a scatterplot that plots the mean aftertaste against the mean aroma, by country.</p>
            <p>After analysing the Coffee Production Plot, we can that Brazil, despite being the biggest producer, has
                some of the lowest scores in both aspects.
                Ethiopia, on the other hand, is the second biggest producer while mantaining some of the highest scores
                in the lots observed, with the best mean aftertaste and the second best mean aroma.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container" id="text-graph2" style="display: none;">

            <p>Here we have a graph that plots different coffee varieties against processing methods. </p>
            <p>The different processing methods cited refer to methods of removing the many layers of the coffee fruit
                in order to obtain its seeds.
                For example, in the most common processing method, washing, many of the layers are removed before the
                drying stage begins,
                as opposed to natural processing, in which the fruit is dried before the removal of its layers.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container" id="text-graph3" style="display: none;">
            <p>Here we have a graph that plots the amount of kilograms of coffee produced by each country.</p>
            <p>By no coincidence, the countries with the highest productions are located in areas of tropical climate,
                which makes sense,
                since arabica coffee's optimal temperaturerange is 18&#x2103 - 21&#x2103,
                tolerating mean annual temperatures up to 24&#x2103.</p>
            <p>Above those moderate temperatures, the seeds ripen more quickly. And since coffee beans are the seeds of
                the plant,
                that means less coffee quality; exposure to temperatures higher than 30&#x2103 can severely damage the
                seedlings,
                stunting growth, yellowing leaves, and even spawning stem tumors.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container" id="text-graph4" style="display: none;">
            <p>This plot aims to show the correlation between the coffee's scores on
                flavor and acidity, using a scatterplot. This type of graphic was chosen because
                it shows that the dots (representing different coffees) tends to have simillar
                scores on these aspects, meaning that when one gets higher, the other tends to
                get higher too. the size of each dot shows how many coffees had tha specific
                rating, since the scores are given in some cathegorical way, and plotting
                without that would lead to some dots overlapping others.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container" id="text-graph5" style="display: none;">
            <p>This map shows, for each country, the mean of overall scores of coffees. There
                is a color bar that represents the possible range of values and colors, and
                each country have a color that show how that country performed in the overall
                scores. This makes the viewer able to rank the countries by this criteria and
                compare two countries just by analyzing their color.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container" id="text-graph6" style="display: none;">
            <p>The objective of this plot is to show the distributions of altitudes of
                coffee harvesting for each country. The chosen graphic type is a set of
                boxplots, since their function is to show the distribution of some variable
                appearances. With this plot, the viewer is able to see the range of possible
                altitutes a country harvest their coffees, and also see if a country harvests
                in a small range of altitudes or if it harvests in varying altitudes.
