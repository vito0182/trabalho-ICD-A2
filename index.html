            <h3>Coffe Quality Visualizations ☕</h3>
            <p>
                In the present work, we made visualizations about coffee quality using Bokeh. The dataset used was
                obtained from the Coffee Quality Institute, a reference institution in the evaluation and certification
                of coffee quality on a global scale. The dataset is avaiable at <a
                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihb/coffee-quality-data-cqi" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee Quality Data CQI</a>. The dataset contains data collected in May 2023, and include a wide range of coffee lots that were sent for evaluation.

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>
                Coffee is a widely appreciated and consumed drink, playing a fundamental role in the culture and economy
                of various countries. Understanding and assessing coffee quality is of utmost importance for producers,
                exporters, roasters and baristas.The <a href="https://www.coffeeinstitute.org/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee Quality Institute</a> plays a crucial role in this context, being
                responsible for establishing standards and guidelines for the evaluation and classification of coffee
                quality. Its work is essential to ensure excellence and consistency in the coffee market, promoting the
                appreciation and recognition of high-quality coffees.

            <p>Here we have a scatterplot that plots the mean aftertaste against the mean aroma, by country.

            </p>
            <p>After analysing the Coffee Production Plot, we can tell that Brazil, despite being the biggest producer, has
                some of the lowest scores in both aspects.
                Ethiopia, on the other hand, is the second biggest producer while mantaining some of the highest scores
                in the lots observed, with the best mean aftertaste and the second best mean aroma.

            <p>Here we have a graph that plots different coffee varieties against processing methods. </p>
            <p>The different processing methods cited refer to methods of removing the many layers of the coffee fruit
                in order to obtain its seeds.
                For example, in the most common processing method, washing, many of the layers are removed before the
                drying stage begins,
                as opposed to natural processing, in which the fruit is dried before the removal of its layers.

            <p>Here we have a graph that plots the amount of kilograms of coffee produced by each country.</p>
            <p>By no coincidence, the countries with the highest productions are located in areas of tropical climate,
                which makes sense,
                since arabica coffee's optimal temperaturerange is 18&#x2103 - 21&#x2103,
                tolerating mean annual temperatures up to 24&#x2103.</p>
            <p>Above those moderate temperatures, the seeds ripen more quickly. And since coffee beans are the seeds of
                the plant,
                that means less coffee quality; exposure to temperatures higher than 30&#x2103 can severely damage the
                seedlings,
                stunting growth, yellowing leaves, and even spawning stem tumors.

            <p>This plot aims to show the correlation between the coffee's scores on
                flavor and acidity, using a scatterplot. This type of graphic was chosen because
                it shows that the dots (representing different coffees) tends to have simillar
                scores on these aspects, meaning that when one gets higher, the other tends to
                get higher too. the size of each dot shows how many coffees had tha specific
                rating, since the scores are given in some cathegorical way, and plotting
                without that would lead to some dots overlapping others.

                each country have a color that show how that country performed in the overall

                boxplots, since their function is to show the distribution of some variable
                appearances. With this plot, the viewer is able to see the range of possible
                altitutes a country harvest their coffees, and also see if a country harvests
                in a small range of altitudes or if it harvests in varying altitudes.

                The objective of this graph is to provide a visual representation of the correlations between coffee
                scores in sensory variables. By listing the sensory variables on the X and Y axes, we can identify the
                relationships between them. Each cell in the graph shows the correlation between two specific variables,
                with the color of the cell indicating the strength of the correlation.
            </p>
            <p>

                This visual representation allows for a deeper understanding of the interactions between the sensory
                characteristics of coffee, which directly impact its overall quality.
